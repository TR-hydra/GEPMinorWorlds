		#LOC_Worlds_Cassanite_displayName = Cassanite^N
		
		#LOC_Worlds_CassanitePrimary_description = A small trans-Nodian object at the proximity of the inner Grannus asteroid belt, kerbalkind has kept an eye on this relatively close body from Nodens a good amount of time to have caught their interest due to the shape of this mysterious rock. Observations also show that it resolves retrograde around the host star Grannus.

		// Saleen
		
		#LOC_Worlds_Saleen_displayName = Saleen^N
		
		#LOC_Worlds_Saleen_description = Saleen is the tiny companion of Cassanite, which shows that there is some more interesting properties around these asteroids that Kerbalkind hasn't yet discovered.

		// Cronos
		
		#LOC_Worlds_Cronos_displayName = Cronos^N
		
		#LOC_Worlds_Cronos_description = One of the more interesting Sironian trojans, it contains its own pair of Rings and an icy surface, its appearance also indicates that it may contain hydrated salts due to its reddish Bands and stripes. The trojan on its own seems very young.

		#LOC_Worlds_Stellate_displayName = Stellate^N
		
		#LOC_Worlds_Stellate_description = Stellate probably has the most interesting shape out of all minor bodies in the outer Grannus belt, it has similarities to a dodecahedron and it seems to be stable enough to maintain it's shape to not directly collapse into a sphere by its own gravity again.
